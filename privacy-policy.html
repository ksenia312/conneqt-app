    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>At Conneqt, your privacy is our top priority. This Privacy Policy details how your data is managed while using our App, which is designed to work offline. We aim to give you full control over your personal information and ensure your messaging experience is both private and secure.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Handling</h2>

    <h3>Data Collection</h3>
    <p>Conneqt is built to respect your privacy. We do not collect personal information, usage data, or analytics. Since the App functions offline, there is no external transmission or processing of your data. You can use Conneqt without worrying about your information being monitored or tracked.</p>

    <h3>Data Storage and Retention</h3>
    <p>All messages, files, and other data are stored locally on your device. This ensures that only you have access to your information. You have complete control over your data—whether you want to keep it or delete it at any time. Once you choose to delete data, it is permanently removed from your device, and we do not keep any backups or copies.</p>

    <h2>2. Security and Privacy</h2>

    <h3>Data Security</h3>
    <p>Your data is secure on your device, as Conneqt does not rely on external servers. </p>

    <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
    <p>Conneqt does not integrate with any third-party services. We do not share your data with any external companies, platforms, or services. Your data remains private and is never used for advertising, marketing, or any other purposes.</p>

    <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>Conneqt is suitable for users of all ages, including children under 13. Since no data is collected, stored, or transmitted, there are no privacy concerns related to children's use of the App. Nevertheless, we recommend that parents and guardians oversee their children's use to ensure a safe and positive experience.</p>

    <h2>3. User Rights and Policy Updates</h2>

    <h3>User Rights</h3>
    <p>As Conneqt does not collect or store any personal information, your rights are automatically protected. You have full control over your data, and you can manage and delete it directly from your device at any time.</p>

    <h3>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect any changes in our practices or to comply with new legal requirements. Any updates will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review the policy regularly to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.</p>
