    <h1>Terms and conditions</h1>
    <h2>1. Introduction and General Information</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Conneqt, a messenger application that allows users to send messages offline via Wi-Fi Direct without
        the
        need for an internet connection. These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the Conneqt application
        ("App" or "Service") provided by Kseniia Nikitina ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"). By using Conneqt, you agree
        to
        comply with and be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use the
        App.</p>
    <p>Conneqt is designed to function without internet-based messaging; it does not utilize any external servers or
        databases, ensuring that all data is stored locally on the user’s device. Our App is available for users
        globally
        where Google Play is accessible, and it does not impose specific restrictions on its audience.</p>

    <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
    <p>Since Conneqt operates anonymously, users are not required to create an account, provide personal information, or
        log
        in to use the App. All communication and data remain local to the user's device, and no external servers or
        databases are used to store user data.</p>

    <h2>3. Use of the Application</h2>
    <p>Conneqt is designed to provide offline communication by enabling users to send messages and files between phones
        when
        there is no internet connection. The App utilizes Wi-Fi Direct for these purposes, ensuring that all data is
        transmitted directly between devices without any reliance on external servers.</p>

    <h3>Allowed Usage</h3>
    <p>Conneqt should be used solely for sending messages and files between devices in environments where internet
        connectivity is unavailable. Users are encouraged to use the App for private communication with friends or known
        contacts.</p>

    <h3>Prohibited Activities</h3>
    <p>While using Conneqt, you agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spamming other users with unsolicited messages or files.</li>
        <li>Stalking, harassing, or intimidating others.</li>
        <li>Sharing malicious files, including viruses, malware, or any other harmful content.</li>
        <li>Engaging in any activity that violates applicable laws or regulations.</li>
        <li>Attempting to reverse engineer, modify, or tamper with the App’s functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any violation of these prohibitions may result in the suspension or termination of your use of the App.</p>

    <h3>User Content</h3>
    <p>Users are solely responsible for the content they share via Conneqt. You must have the necessary rights and
        permissions to share any messages, files, or content through the App. By sharing content, you confirm that it
        does
        not infringe on the intellectual property rights or privacy rights of any third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. Payment and Refunds</h2>
    <p>Conneqt is a free application. There are no charges for downloading, installing, or using the App, and there are
        no
        in-app purchases or subscription fees. As such, there is no payment or refund policy applicable to the use of
        Conneqt.</p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
    <h3>App Ownership</h3>
    <p>The Conneqt application, including its code, design, and all associated content, is owned by Kseniia Nikitina,
        the
        Flutter Developer who created it in 2024 ("Owner"). All rights, title, and interest in and to the App remain the
        exclusive property of Kseniia Nikitina. Any unauthorized use of the App's intellectual property, including its
        code,
        design, trademarks, or other proprietary information, is strictly prohibited.</p>

    <h3>User-Generated Content</h3>
    <p>Users retain ownership of any messages, files, or content they share through Conneqt. By using the App, users
        confirm
        that they have the necessary rights to share such content. The App does not claim any ownership rights over
        user-generated content; however, the user grants Conneqt a limited license to transmit their messages and files
        to
        the recipient’s device for the purpose of facilitating communication. This license is solely for the operation
        of
        the App and does not allow the use of user-generated content for any other purpose.</p>

    <h3>Restrictions on Use</h3>
    <p>Users are not permitted to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Copy, modify, or distribute the App or any part of it without prior written permission from the Owner.</li>
        <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the App.</li>
        <li>Use the App in any unlawful manner or for any illegal purposes.</li>
        <li>Create derivative works based on the App or any part of its content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Failure to comply with these restrictions may result in the suspension or termination of the user's right to use
        Conneqt and may also lead to legal action.</p>

    <h2>6. Termination and Suspension of Use</h2>
    <p>Conneqt reserves the right to take necessary action, including reporting violations to relevant platform
        providers or
        initiating legal action against users who violate these Terms or engage in harmful conduct towards other users,
        third parties, or the App itself.</p>

    <h3>Grounds for Reporting or Termination</h3>
    <p>The following actions, among others, may result in the reporting or suspension of a user's access to Conneqt:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Violating these Terms and Conditions.</li>
        <li>Engaging in prohibited activities such as spamming, stalking, harassment, or sharing malicious files.</li>
        <li>Attempting to reverse engineer, modify, or tamper with the App.</li>
        <li>Using the App for illegal purposes or in a manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the
            functionality of the App.
        </li>
        <li>Any activity that breaches the intellectual property rights of the Owner or other users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Process for Reporting or Termination</h3>
    <p>While Conneqt does not currently have the functionality to suspend or terminate user access directly, we reserve
        the
        right to report violations to platform providers or take legal action as necessary. Upon termination or
        reporting,
        any data stored locally on the user’s device will remain unaffected. We reserve the right to take any necessary
        legal action against users who violate these Terms.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability and Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>Conneqt and its Owner, Kseniia Nikitina, shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental,
        consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the App. The App is provided "as is" and "as
        available,"
        without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties
        of
        merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>
    <p>We do not guarantee that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free from viruses or other harmful
        components. Users are solely responsible for any damage to their devices or data loss that may result from using
        the
        App.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to the Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting
        the
        updated Terms in the App. Your continued use of the App after the posting of revised Terms signifies your
        acceptance
        of such changes. It is your responsibility to review these Terms periodically.</p>
