    <h1>Child Safety Standards (CSAE Policy)</h1>

    <p>
        At Conneqt, we take child safety seriously. We have a zero-tolerance policy for
        Child Sexual Abuse and Exploitation (CSAE) and any content or behavior that harms
        or endangers minors.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Zero-Tolerance Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We do not allow any content, actions, or attempts to use the App for CSAE purposes.
        This includes creating, sharing, requesting, distributing, or promoting child sexual
        abuse material (CSAM), or any behavior intended to groom, exploit, or harm a minor.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Prohibited Content & Behavior</h2>
    <p>The following is strictly prohibited:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any content that sexualizes minors or depicts, promotes, or facilitates CSAE.</li>
        <li>Any attempt to solicit, groom, threaten, exploit, or abuse a minor.</li>
        <li>Sharing, requesting, or distributing CSAM/CSAE-related content (including links).</li>
        <li>Using the App to coordinate, recruit, traffic, or exploit minors in any way.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Reporting Child Safety Concerns</h2>
    <p>
        If you encounter any content or behavior that may violate these standards, please contact us
        immediately. When reporting, include any relevant details (e.g., what happened, dates/times,
        usernames, screenshots) so we can review the issue.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Enforcement</h2>
    <p>
        We may take appropriate action in response to reports or suspected violations, including
        restricting access, suspending or terminating accounts (if applicable), and removing content
        where technically possible. We also reserve the right to preserve relevant information for
        safety and legal compliance purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Cooperation with Authorities</h2>
    <p>
        Where required or appropriate, we may report suspected CSAE/CSAM to relevant authorities and
        cooperate with lawful requests.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Scope & App Design Note</h2>
    <p>
        Conneqt is designed to work offline and does not collect or transmit user data to external servers.
        However, these standards apply to any use of the App and any attempts to use it for harmful or illegal
        purposes. We encourage parents and guardians to supervise children’s device and app usage.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Updates to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Child Safety Standards (CSAE Policy) from time to time. Any updates will be posted
        on this page. Please review it periodically to stay informed.
